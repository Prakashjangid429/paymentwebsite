              <p>
                Spiral Pay was founded in 2018 by a team of fintech veterans who recognized the need for a more secure,
                efficient, and developer-friendly payment processing solution in India. Frustrated by the complexity and
                high costs of existing platforms, we set out to build something better for Indian businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting in a small Mumbai office, our founders combined decades of experience from leading Indian
                fintech companies and global payment processors to create a platform that prioritizes security,
                simplicity, and scalability for the Indian market.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Spiral Pay processes over â‚¹20,000 crores annually for more than 15,000 businesses across India.
                We've grown from a team of 3 to over 150 employees across multiple offices in Mumbai, Bangalore, and
                Delhi, but our mission remains the same: to make payments simple, secure, and accessible for every
                Indian business.
